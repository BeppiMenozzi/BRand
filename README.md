# BRand
Just a collection of useful static shortcuts that come handy when randomization is needed.

All you have to do is include this library in your work and start using it. No initialization needed.
Type BRand. and your TAB key in your favourite editor to get the list of available functions.
Type CTRL-Q if you work on IntelliJ, when on a function, to see its description.
